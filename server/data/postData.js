      postContent: "<p>Ok wow. That worked...the site is <b>live</b>. <br> </br>You can imagine my excitement, after some hours of tinkerin\
      g when, simultaneously, my favorite Underworld song played and I had managed to figure out the correct key-strokes that\
       made this page re-appear from the dark side of deployment. Sparing the reader from a wall-of-text (this post is writte\
      n in a MongoDB object, for now), I intend to take this brief moment to rejoice in my small corner of the internet. </p> <br> </br><p>This\
       page emerged as a brief diversion from my foray into reading in bioinformatics. I'd be remiss if I didn't take the opp\
      ortunity to document my metamorphosis from the start. What was initially just an HTML page, is now running an API on a \
      NodeJS/Express server connected to MongoDB. On the front-end, I have opted for a ReactJS library and enjoyed learning t\
      he Redux framework's patterns to route data between the app and MongoDB. The site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, run\
      ning Ubuntu with Nginx web-server. Inspired by the idea of a digital garden, I will be using this site as a sandbox for\
       various web-app projects and hope to maintain the site regularly with reports on stuff learned, struggled with, and ge\
      nerally improved upon. </p><br> </br> <pre class='line-numbers' style='color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4'> <code class='language-java' data-lang='java'><span style='display:flex'><span>let x =5 </span></span> <span style='display:flex'> <span> x += 6 </span></span></code></pre> <p>The audience is my future self, but I have come to realize that sharing my journey is an importa\
      nt step toward community - which is my ultimate goal with this website. I am glad I took ownership of this project to s\
      ee through a working prototype that I can improve upon. Special thanks to my potential mentor/PI who is a source of mot\
      ivation, @DannyArends (also, active in open-education wthin the bioinformatic academic community). @FullStackJunkie (fo\
      r lucid demonstrations on responsive UI) and @Jaewonhimnae (AWS deployment + nifty tools like FTP/FileZilla). Working w\
      ithin the shell, installing package utilities, and seeing the backend take on a higher-order purpose have made me keen \
      about working with command-line. I now have much respect for the complexity web-developers deal with today and recommen\
      d such a project if only to gain perspective on the state of things in 2022. There is much to learn and even more to wr\
      ite about. Now to figure out a way to publish from emacs or jupyter-notebooks....stay tuned. Excuse the cringe handle; \
      I like tetramers and it was unique. woot!</p>"
